# Kaminari Project

## Overview

The Kaminari Project is an initiative designed for individual use, aiming to contribute to personal development. It has several core objectives: to make the mass consumption of video content understandable and manageable, to simplify the process of researching and filtering anime content, and to enable users to quickly find and immediately start watching their desired movies and TV shows, thereby reducing the inclination towards illegal sites that detract from the enjoyment of viewing with advertisements and malware.

Specifically for anime content, the project allows users to store the anime they have watched or plan to watch in a personal library, rate these contents, and filter through their anime libraries. Additionally, a page visualizing preferences through graphs enables users to gain in-depth insights into their watching habits and preferences.

Furthermore, the Kaminari Project offers similar facilities for movies and TV series, allowing users to swiftly access and commence watching the content they search for. The project also includes features that facilitate shared content consumption, aiming to make planning movie nights with friends or family more enjoyable and enhancing shared viewing experiences.

All these features of the Kaminari Project assist users in personalizing and optimizing their individual viewing experiences.

> It is imperative to note that the project is strictly non-commercial and must be used in compliance with the terms of use of the resources it relies on. Unauthorized and commercial use is prohibited, and adherence to these rules is expected.
